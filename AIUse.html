<h1>Use of Artificial Intelligence in Blog Application Development</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This document describes how Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were used during the development
        of a blog application, with a particular focus on the <strong>admin functionality</strong>,
        <strong>frontend rendering</strong>, and <strong>AJAX-based interactions</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI assistance was used as a development support tool to accelerate implementation, improve
        code quality, and validate architectural decisions. All final code was reviewed, adapted,
        and integrated manually by the developer.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2. Admin Functionality Development</h2>
    <p>
        AI was used to help design and implement the admin panel of the blog application.
        The admin panel allows administrators to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create, edit, and delete blog posts</li>
        <li>Manage users and roles</li>
        <li>View and manage subscriptions</li>
        <li>Access all admin features through protected routes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI assistance helped generate:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Express.js admin routes</li>
        <li>Middleware logic for admin authorization</li>
        <li>EJS templates for admin pages</li>
        <li>Clean separation between API endpoints and rendered pages</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>3. Frontend Development (EJS + HTML + CSS)</h2>
    <p>
        AI was also used during frontend development to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Structure EJS templates for admin and blog pages</li>
        <li>Create simple, readable HTML layouts</li>
        <li>Design a minimal and consistent CSS style for the admin interface</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The frontend remains server-rendered using EJS, while JavaScript is used only where dynamic
        interaction is required (AJAX actions).
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>4. Use of AI for AJAX Functionality</h2>
    <p>
        A major area where AI assistance was used is the implementation of AJAX-based functionality.
        This allows the admin panel to perform actions without full page reloads.
    </p>

    <h3>4.1 AJAX Create / Edit / Delete for Posts</h3>
    <p>
        AI was used to help design JavaScript functions that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Submit forms using <code>fetch()</code></li>
        <li>Send JSON payloads to Express endpoints</li>
        <li>Handle POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods</li>
        <li>Update the UI after successful operations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 AJAX Pagination of Posts</h3>
    <p>
        AI assistance was also used to design AJAX-based pagination for blog posts. This allows users
        to load additional posts dynamically without refreshing the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The AI helped with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pagination query parameters (page, limit)</li>
        <li>Backend endpoint design for paginated results</li>
        <li>Frontend JavaScript logic to fetch and append posts</li>
        <li>Improving user experience through incremental loading</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>5. Example Prompts Used</h2>
    <p>
        Below are examples of prompts used to guide the AI during development. These prompts were
        adapted and refined iteratively as the project evolved.
    </p>

    <h3>5.1 Admin CRUD Functionality</h3>
    <pre>
Create an Express.js admin router for a blog app with EJS views.
I need AJAX-based create, edit, and delete for posts.
Do not change my existing Mongoose models.
    </pre>

    <h3>5.2 AJAX Edit and Delete for Posts</h3>
    <pre>
Rewrite my admin post management to use proper HTML forms
and fetch-based AJAX instead of browser prompts.
Include edit and delete functionality.
    </pre>

    <h3>5.3 AJAX Pagination of Posts</h3>
    <pre>
Create an AJAX pagination system for blog posts.
The backend uses Express and MongoDB.
The frontend uses vanilla JavaScript and EJS.
Posts should load dynamically without page refresh.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>6. Role of AI in the Development Process</h2>
    <p>
        AI was used as a <strong>supporting development tool</strong>, not as a replacement for
        developer decision-making. The AI helped:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Speed up boilerplate generation</li>
        <li>Provide architectural suggestions</li>
        <li>Debug authentication and middleware issues</li>
        <li>Improve clarity and structure of code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All AI-generated content was reviewed, tested, and modified as needed to meet project
        requirements and coding standards.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The use of AI significantly improved development efficiency and helped implement robust
        admin and frontend functionality for the blog application. By combining AI-generated
        guidance with hands-on development and debugging, the project achieved a clean,
        maintainable, and feature-complete result.
